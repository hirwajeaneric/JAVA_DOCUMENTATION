The objective of this chapter is to find a way to save states or send files or 
projects as they were in our java programs to reach or be reused as they were before.

There are therefore many different ways to do it.
1. Use serialization if your data will be used by only the Java Program that 
    generated it. To make a class serializable, create a class and implement serializable.
    HOWEVER: If you don't want one of the classes of your instances to be serialized, 
    Or if you want it to be skipped, Mark an it as transient.
    EX: 
    import java.net.*;
    class Chat implements serializable {
        transient String currentID;
        String username;
        //More code
    }
