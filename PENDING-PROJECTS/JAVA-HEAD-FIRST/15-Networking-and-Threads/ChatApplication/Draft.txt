//How to create a thread?
Thread t = new Thread();
t.start();

//Threads do not run alone. Without the task or code to run, it dies immediately.
A thread is a separate 'thread of execution'.
In other words, a separate call stack.
A Thread is a Java class that represents a thread. 
To make a thread make a Thread.

//Another thing to be taken in consideration is the runnable object (the thread's job)
Runnable threadJob = new MyRunnable();

//This is how it is done

Runnable threadJob = new MyRunnable();
Thread myThread = new Thread(threadJob);
myThread.start();
