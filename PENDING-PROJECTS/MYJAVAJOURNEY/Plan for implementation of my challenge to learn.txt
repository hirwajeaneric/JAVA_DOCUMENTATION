********************************************************************************************
IMPLEMENTATION:
********************************************************************************************




HOW SHALL I IMPLEMENT ALL THESE PROJECTS IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT BE STRESSING ME?

I. I will do all these listed stuffs with only one objective:
	Learning and understanding how things work.
	Experience and the ability to solve problems using my experience
	Boosting my creativity in the industry in which I am
	Generate income by the use of my skills in a controlled way.
	Do things that literaly solve my own or other people's problems rather than doing stuffs which help me to raise my ego yet without improving in a tangible and practical way
	Make what I do, design and development a career to pays me well, but also that I enjoy and that I am also ready to make new and innovative things into.
	
II. Work on these stuffs in a progressive an parallel way. In such cases, there will be no problems of retardation or having projects which are pended or forgoten.

	That will be accomplished in this way.
	I have 5 areas to work on:
		1. JAVA Programming
		2. Graphic Design
		3. Web Design
		4. Wordpress
		5. UX/UI Design
		
	I will be working on these areas according to those which will not be exhausting me:
	This means that I won't be working on areas which all will be requirering writing codes. 
	For instance, I won't take JAVA and Web Design together.
	I also won't take Graphic Design and UX/UI Design together.
	I also won't take Wordpress together with web Design.
	
	IN A BETTER WAY OF DOING THINGS, EACH ONE HAS TO BE A RECREATION FROM ANOTHER ONE.
	Otherwise, I would fall in the problem of feeling uninterested since I stay in stuffs too 	long that it becomes no more enjoyable.
	
	I will therefore be learning and working on all these like this:
	1. JAVA + UX/UI Design
	2. WordPress + Graphic Design
	3. WebDesign + Reading about Design and other books
	
	I will be doing this in an alternating manner where I will be taking 3 Days to work on a project, rest one day and repeat another section of 3 days before moving to another series.
	
	This means that It would be taking me 3 weeks to end the Circle.
	However, According to the time In which I will be in, I will also be choosing tasks that I will be doing on a regural basis due to the objective at hand.
	
	Every 3 Days of work will be made of # parts:
	1. Preparation and setting Goals
	2. Execution
	3. Self-evaluation and noting down remarks.
	
SO HERE IS A TIMETABLE:

Before the year ends, I am left with 17 weeks.

I will make 6 circles of these tasks before ending the year.
