How I understand this project:

We need:
1. A class called CITIZENS which contain: CitizenId, fullname, and phonenumber
2. A class called VACCINATION that contains: CitizenId, fullname, phonenumber, VaccineBrand, and VaccinationDate
3. An Enum Class called VACCINEBRAND that contains names of vaccines.

4. A form that saves all the above data from the VaccinationClass as VACCINATION REGISTRY:
    - CitizenId, fullname, phonenumber, Vaccined or not, VaccineBrand,and VaccinationDate
5.
